				<p class="first-p">
					Our journey dates back to 2002, when our Co-Founder, Dr. Jeph Akaehie
					who was living in a small village in Owerri West, Imo State, Nigeria
					with his late father ( PLANT RESEARCHER), picked deeper interest in
					medicinal plants after he was healed of hernia using herbs.
				</p>

				<p class="first-p">
					In early 2002, there were lots of youths infected with various STDâ€™s
					in the small village where Dr. Jeph lived and due to his closeness to
					his late father, the youths trusted and confided in him for
					treatments.
				</p>

				<p class="first-p">
					He decided to try out some of the medicinal plants he was taught and
					boom, more and more people were coming including expectant couples and
					the amazing outcomes announced us.
